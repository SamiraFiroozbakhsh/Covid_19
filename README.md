This code is a comprehensive tool designed for analyzing and modeling the spread of COVID-19. It performs the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads COVID-19 patient data from a CSV file.
Processes data to compute cumulative statistics such as infected, deceased, recovered, hospitalized, and susceptible individuals.
Normalizes and organizes data into a structured format for further analysis.
Cumulative Calculations:

Computes cumulative sums for key variables, such as cumulative infections and recoveries.
Applies smoothing techniques using rolling averages to reduce noise in the data.
Neural Network and Predictions:

Implements a custom neural network (e.g., a DINN model) to model and predict the dynamics of COVID-19 using differential equations.
Defines key parameters (e.g., alpha, beta) for fitting the model to real-world data.
Data Interpolation and Refinement:

Uses interpolation methods to fill missing values and ensure continuity in time-series data.
Outputs cleaned and interpolated datasets for additional analysis.
Visualization and Export:

Provides visualization options to examine trends, such as the spread and recovery rates over time.
Exports processed and modeled data to CSV files for further use.
Objective:
The goal of this code is to provide a systematic way to analyze, predict, and model the progression of a pandemic using advanced techniques like neural networks and epidemiological modeling. It helps researchers and policymakers make informed decisions by providing insights into the spread and control measures of the disease.
